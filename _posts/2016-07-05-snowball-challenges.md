As mentioned in the previous post, I altered the speed a little. Slowed it down to allow more reaction time, and give the player a better chance to see things as they happen. Feeling fairly happy with this change. Another change I needed to make concerned the UI, as I added in some new mechanics and the UI needed to be shifted around. You can see I moved the resource bar moved to the top.

The reason for this was the addition of a jump ability, the next addition to the player's toolbox. Upon completing the first challenge, the player will unlock the jump ability. The game will then start spawning a trap that requires a jump to get over it. You can see the jump button on the bottom right.

The jump also can be used to avoid the fire pits, but it does cost a bit more energy to use over throwing the snowball. Now, one can use it to go over multiple fire pits, depending on how they stack. So having both the jump & throw abilities can help for different situations.

In order to unlock the jump you need to complete a challenge. The actually criteria for the challenge hasn't been nailed down, but for now it's to throw 5 snowballs at 5 pits. When the game starts up, it will show you want your current challenge is.

## Next Steps

Aside from a couple bugs I wish to tackle, the next set of things to work on will be primarily adding further challenges. Then after that start looking at powerups/items to use as you go through the game. This will involve both the implementation when going through the game, as well as a UI screen for it. I am considering doing a UI screen for the challenges you have yet to unlock as well.
