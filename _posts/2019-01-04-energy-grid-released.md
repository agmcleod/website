This week I released Energy Grid. It's out now for Windows, Mac, and Linux. You can find it here.

The last couple of changes included tweaks to the settings UI, creating an end screen, which tells you how many cities you supplied power for. A number of bug fixes, mainly with the tutorial. As well as working on the music.

Check it out, and let me know what you think. Happy New Year!
