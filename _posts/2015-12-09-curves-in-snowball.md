It's been a busy week, but I found some time to get back to working on the game. I implemented the much needed curves to the terrain generation.

![Example of a procedurally generated right curve in the track](/assets/snowball-curves.png)

It feels pretty cool! I definitely need to get it working in random, so I can add a curve, chop off segments behind the player, and then generate new ones on the fly. After that, I will look at adding up & down slopes.

In addition to gamedev, i've been doing a fair bit of [advent of code](http://adventofcode.com), which is a programmer challenge advent calendar. The problems do tend to align with mathematic challenges, but are more programmer-y than [project euler](http://projecteuler.net). I've been using Rust to do them, but you can use any language. Check it out if you're looking for a nice break from the usual.
