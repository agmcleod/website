As the game gets closer to release, I've worked on a few skins that you'll be able to purchase, and use to your heart's content. I wanted to make some that were a bit out there, and out of place, to make things more fun.

Since animating a rotating sphere proved difficult, I decided to make a flat texture, and leverage blender to make some of the frame by frame animations for these. First time doing 3d texturing in well over a decade, UVs are hard! I give much respect to those who work on 3d games, and animated motion pictures.

Here's the first skin I completed:

It's a large rock that gains & shrinks just as the normal snowball. I experimented with more of a golf ball type look, but felt it didn't give the look I want. So I ended up using a low poly sphere.

The next skin is a bowling ball.

The type of ball that most of us have rolled along a surface at some point. Bowling balls come in a range of patterns and designs. I wanted a nice blue one to keep with the existing colour theme. Then lined it with red, purple, green, orange bits so you can see it spin. Along with the typical three hols to grip the ball with.

To follow the trend of games that you play for a fun night out:

I naturally had to add an 8 ball. Making the texture for this was pretty straight forward, but as I mentioned earlier, getting the UVs right so it wasn't stretched was a challenge. I'm fairly happy with the result now, and I hope you like it.

By far my favourite skin though is this one:

I generally haven't caught on to the retro + pixel art trend going on in games, but I understand the appeal. I decided to give this a try, and I'm really happy how it turned out. I initially tried the same base colour as the standard snowball, but I found white worked better. I also added square versions of the little spots that wrap around the snowball.

## Game Progress

As far as the state of development, I'm on the final touches of the game now. I'm working on getting game music complete, as well as working on an android build. Look out for a release coming soon!
