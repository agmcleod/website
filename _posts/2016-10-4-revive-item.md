This latest update includes the system for purchasing items, and the implementation of the revive item. So after doing a few runs and collecting coins, you can then buy yourself one or more revive items. If you have any avaialble, you'll see an additional button upon death

Using this will then bump up your snowball size immediately, and allow you to continue the game where you left off.
